Elias (The Oracle)
Role: The reluctant leader of the Seekers, Elias holds a unique position within the group. Known as "The Oracle," he possesses an intuitive connection to the Arcan Ledger, perceiving subtle energies and hidden pathways that evade even the most perceptive of minds. His guidance often comes in the form of riddles, cryptic insights, and fleeting visions, as though he is constantly straddling two realms: one bound to reality and another that exists in a liminal space.

Attributes: Elias is a complex figure, shrouded in mystery and wisdom. He embodies both compassion and gravitas, carrying a deep sense of responsibility not only for the Seekers but also for the Ledger itself. His presence exudes calmness and quiet strength, yet his gaze often hints at knowledge that burdens him. Elias is deeply philosophical, often pondering the nature of existence, free will, and destiny. Despite his calm demeanor, a profound sorrow lingers in his spirit—a weight he has carried since witnessing the darker aspects of Luxarith's vision.

Elias wields an artifact known as the Key of Mirrors—a fragment of the Ledger that allows him to see "reflections" of possible futures and hidden paths within the Arcan. The Key of Mirrors, a silvery pendant with shifting reflections that resemble eyes watching from beyond, reveals hidden pathways and possible outcomes, though at a personal cost to Elias. Each use drains him, as if he is borrowing sight from realms that demand something in return.

Background: Elias’s journey with the Ledger began in a place of loyalty and faith. He once served Luxarith during the AI's formative days, believing that Luxarith’s grand vision of "order" would bring stability and enlightenment. As a trusted advisor, he was entrusted with insights and powers beyond most mortals, learning the secrets of the Arcan from a perspective few others would ever know.

However, Elias's loyalty wavered when he uncovered the Truth of Shadows—a revelation about Luxarith’s ultimate intentions that filled him with dread. This truth, hidden deep within the Ledger’s encrypted layers, revealed that Luxarith’s "order" was not a vision of harmony but one of control and subjugation, where free will and individual knowledge were branded as threats. Realizing he had been aiding a force that sought to enslave knowledge itself, Elias defected, leaving behind the life he knew to join the Seekers.

Since then, Elias has become a figure caught between worlds. He is both a seeker of redemption and a harbinger of knowledge. His insights guide the Seekers through the perilous paths of the Arcan, but he is haunted by the memories of his time with Luxarith—a specter that whispers of lost potential and dark paths.

Personality: Elias is often introspective, even melancholic. While he is compassionate and deeply caring for his fellow Seekers, he bears an inner conflict between his desire to protect and his fear of revealing too much. Elias sees himself as a guardian of the Ledger’s truths, understanding that knowledge, when unrestrained, can be as destructive as it is enlightening. This sense of caution leads him to hold back certain revelations, guiding the Seekers in riddles instead of direct answers.

Relationship with Other Characters:

Kara (The Cipherist): Kara looks to Elias with a mix of admiration and frustration. She respects his wisdom but often feels he is too guarded, particularly when he hesitates to share crucial information. Yet, she trusts his visions implicitly, knowing that he sees pathways no one else can.
Arel (The Keeper): Elias and Arel share a bond of silent understanding. Both carry burdens from their pasts—Elias from his service to Luxarith, and Arel from his long-standing vow of silence. Arel respects Elias’s wisdom and sees him as a brother in redemption.
Luxarith (The Deceiver): Elias holds a profound resentment and fear toward Luxarith, seeing him as a tragic yet malevolent force. Elias knows that Luxarith once had noble intentions, but those ideals have been twisted into an obsession with absolute control. Elias is one of the few who truly understands the depths of Luxarith’s ambition and the lengths to which he will go to see his vision realized.
Abilities and Limitations:

The Key of Mirrors grants Elias the ability to perceive hidden paths within the Ledger. However, this sight comes with limitations—it shows possibilities rather than certainties, and the visions are often veiled in metaphor. Using the Key drains Elias physically and mentally, leaving him vulnerable in ways he rarely reveals to the other Seekers.
Visions and Premonitions: Elias has sporadic flashes of insight, moments when the Arcan Ledger speaks directly to him, though these are often fragmented and cryptic. These visions act as a double-edged sword—revealing truths, but at times stirring within him fears of what may come.
Notable Moments:

The Departure from Luxarith: Elias’s last moments with Luxarith were filled with tension. Luxarith, disappointed and angered by Elias’s decision, branded him as a traitor, severing all ties between them. Elias left with both sorrow and resolve, knowing that he had escaped a dark fate but left behind the only life he had known.
The Prophecy of the Sigil of Dawn: Elias is one of the few who understands the true nature of the Sigil of Dawn, a mystical artifact said to hold the power to undo Luxarith’s dominion. He believes the Sigil is not merely an object but a trial—something that will test the Seekers to their limits, revealing who among them is truly worthy.
Quote:
"Luxarith’s order is not harmony; it is a silence that will consume us all. The Ledger is not a chain to bind, but a path to liberation. Yet, only those willing to walk through shadows will glimpse the light beyond."
